#Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of programmatic coding in iOS app development. Coming from a background heavily reliant on storyboards, this repository allows me to document and revisit various programming concepts. Moreover, I hope it serves as a helpful resource for anyone else transitioning from storyboards to programmatic coding.

#Prerequisites

To explore these examples, you'll need:

Xcode installed on your machine.
Basic knowledge of coding languages, particularly Swift.
#Author

Hello! I'm Johnathan Huijon, an aspiring iOS developer and a graduate of the University of Texas at Austin. My journey into iOS development began with storyboards, and this project marks my transition into programmatic coding. In addition to coding, I enjoy kayaking, hiking, and video games. As I continue learning, I plan to expand this repository to cover networking, API calls, and showcase personal projects in separate repositories. If you'd like to reach out, feel free to email me at johnathan.huijon@gmail.com.
