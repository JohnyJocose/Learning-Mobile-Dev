// This file provides an overview of math operators, including arithmetic operators and the remainder operator. It covers essential concepts such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as the modulo operator for calculating remainders. Understanding these operators is fundamental to performing mathematical calculations in programming.

// Arithmetic Operators

// Swift supports the four standard arithmetic operators for all number types:
1 + 2 // Addition (+)
5 - 3 // Subtraction (-)
2 * 3 // Multiplication (*)
10.0 / 2.5 // Division (/) 10.0 / 2.5
// When using division or other operators that involve decimals, make sure to work with float or double data types. Using integers (Int) may result in truncation of decimal values, which can lead to unexpected results.



// Remainder Operator

// The remainder operator (a % b) works out how many multiples of b will fit inside a and returns the value thatâ€™s left over (known as the remainder).
9 % 4    // equals 1
